# CIS6930-Human Centered Input Recognition Algorithms
This repository consists the two projects I did under the course Human Centered Input Recognition Algorithms.

## Goals acheived
- Project 1 is the implementation of the [$1 recognizer](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/index.html#:~:text=The%20%241%20Unistroke%20Recognizer%20is,i.e.%2C%20a%20geometric%20template%20matcher. "$1 recognizer").The entire project is implemented in java. The project is divided into 5 parts and they are as mentioned below.
  -  Drawing on a Canvas
  -  Online/Live Recognition
  -  Offline/Test Recognition
  -  Collecting Data from People
  -  Exploring Data from People
